### The ultimate [Schema Markup](https://rankmath.com/wordpress/plugin/schema-markup-rich-snippets/) Plugin for WordPress
★★★★★<br>

### What are Rich Snippets?
Normally, when your website shows up in the search results, it contains basic information about your website like the page title, URL, and a meta description. With Rich Snippets, you can enhance that search engine presence with *rich* results. Google supports many types of Structured Data, and some of the examples would be results with a star rating, results with images, results with additional links, and many more.

Appearing in rich results also means that your website stands out in the search results, which leads to [better click-through rates](https://sites.google.com/site/webmasterhelpforum/en/faq-rich-snippets#why) and more traffic.

### What is Schema Markup (aka Structured Data)?
Search engines are getting better at understanding language, but they are far from perfect. To help search engines understand the content better, a micro-data standard was developed. The premise behind the standard is that by providing search engines additional data about the page in a structured manner, search engines can understand the content of the page better, and hence can rank those pages better in the search results. Many ways have been created to add this micro-data to pages, and **Schema Markup** is one of the most important ones. So, in essence, **Schema Markup is what leads to rich results or rich snippets.**

### Where to Add Schema Markup?
Schema is meta-data, which means data-about-data. In this case, the data we're talking about is your page content, and this Schema is additional data about your page content.

Schema is usually added to the page header, but if you use the Schema Markup Plugin, you'll be able to add Schema micro-data to your posts right inside WordPress, while you're creating your post.

### What Does Rich Snippets Do?
When the appropriate Schema is added to your website and posts, Google and other search engines understand your website better, which ultimately leads to rich snippets.

Rich Snippets do a lot of things for your website. They are visually appealing and are a sign of trust. That means that your website automatically looks authoritative and trustworthy when it appears as a rich snippet. Since rich snippets are also visually appealing, they stand out in the search results, which increases the likelihood that users will choose your website over the competition. This improves your click-through rate and ultimately your rankings.

We've developed the Schema Markup Plugin so that you can take advantage of appearing as rich snippets in the search results without dealing with a mess of code. We've made it incredibly simple for anyone to add the appropriate micro-data to their pages—regardless of what your page is about. Here is a list of all the micro-data supported by the Schema Markup Plugin.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why would I need to use Schema Markup Plugin?

Search Engines are still not perfect, and they don't understand natural written language, as well as humans, do. To bridge this gap, you can add structured markup (loosely called Rich Snippets) to your posts and your website. Using the markup, Google and other search engines understand your website better, and that increases your chances of ranking higher in the search results. Adding structured metadata is also mandatory if you want to qualify for rich snippets (where your search results are accompanied by stars), or other rich results that Google presents in the SERPs.

### Will using this plugin guarantee that rich snippets will show up for my website?

No. There is no guarantee that your site will start displaying rich results after installing the plugin. That is because displaying Rich Snippets is completely at Google's discretion, and they have not made any criteria for choosing websites public. However, there is a silver lining. Even if Google doesn't show rich results for your website in the search results, adding meta-data to your posts will still help Google understand your website better, which definitely increases your chances of ranking higher.

### Will it work with my current SEO plugin like Yoast, All In One SEO, SEO Framework, SEOPress etc.?

Yes. The plugin is designed to work with any SEO plugin and theme which follows WordPress coding standards. You can safely install and configure the Schema Markup plugin to use with your current SEO plugin.

### Is this an install it and forget-it type plugin?

No. Schema Markup Plugin makes it easy for you to add search engine compliant structured markup to your website. Instead of tweaking code, Schema Markup Plugin adds easy to fill in data-boxes alongside each post and automatically adds the appropriate markup based on the information *you provide*. The key information here is that Rich Snippets just makes it easy for you to add the meta-data, but you still have to provide what the meta-data will be.

### Do I need coding skills to use this plugin?

No, you do not need any coding skills to use Schema Markup Plugin. In fact, we've created Schema Markup Plugin specifically to take the complex task of dealing with code out of the equation.

### What is the process of using the plugin?

The process is pretty simple. Install the Schema Markup Plugin and activate it. You will then see an option to add structured metadata alongside each of your posts and pages. Choose the appropriate markup from the dropdown, and then fill in the meta-data fields that appear. Schema Markup Plugin will appropriately add the structured meta-data to your post.

### Will installing Schema Markup Plugin increase my site traffic?

There is no guarantee, as there are hundreds of other factors involved, but adding structured meta-data using the Schema Markup Plugin will definitely increase the probability of receiving more traffic from search engines.

### I installed Schema Markup Plugin, but my website does not appear with any rich snippet, why is that?

Appearing with rich results is not a right; it is a privilege. Even if you've added the appropriate markup to your website and posts, your website might not appear in rich results. There can be many reasons for that, and [this article](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/why-your-rich-snippets-are-not-appearing/203720/) highlights some of the important ones.

### How can I get support for this plugin?

We offer limited support for the plugin through the WordPress repository, and we recommend that you open any support related tickets on [our community forum](https://support.rankmath.com/product/rich-snippets/).

### Will I need to add the meta-data manually?

Yes and no. Technically, adding the meta-data manually means tampering with code, which is not easy and not everyone can do it. When you install the Schema Markup Plugin, you will have the easy option of adding the meta-data of your post alongside the post, which is easy, quick, and efficient. So, the process can be called as manual, but it much better than the actual manual process.

### Do I need to add rich snippets to each of my posts?

It is not necessary to add structured meta-data to all your posts, but it is recommended. If your website has a lot of pages, we would recommend that you start with the most important pages and go from there.

### Does this plugin cover all possible rich snippets?

Yes and no. Schema Markup Plugin covers the most important types of meta-data, and we will add support for new ones over time. But, it will not be possible to cover all rich-snippet types as there are hundreds of them. Check out the full hierarchy of supported meta-data on [Schema's website](https://schema.org/docs/full.html).

### How do I know this plugin is working?

There are a couple of ways of checking the results of this plugin. If you start adding meta-data to your posts and your website is appearing as a rich result, then it's obvious that the Schema Markup Plugin is working. But, sometimes Google might not show your posts as rich results even if the appropriate meta-data is added. To check if the meta-data is added appropriately, you can use [Google's Structured Data Markup Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool). Some of the information will also be present in your Google Search Console account.
